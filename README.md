# Bank Note Analysis

## Goal of the Project
The Goal of this project is to classify banknote as fake or genuine using Machine Learning Algorithms.




## STEPS

## Dataset information

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset.

## Data Modelling

Data modeling is the coronary heart of data analysis. A model takes the organized data as input and gives the preferred output. This step consists of selecting the suitable kind of model, whether the problem is a classification problem, or a regression problem or a clustering problem. After deciding on the model family, amongst the number of algorithms amongst that family, we need to cautiously pick out the algorithms to put into effect and enforce them. We need to tune the hyperparameters of every model to obtain the preferred performance. We additionally need to make positive there is the right stability between overall performance and generalizability. We do no longer desire the model to study the data and operate poorly on new data.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.
